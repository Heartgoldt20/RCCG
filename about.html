                <h3>About Stichting Glory Tabernacle Parish </h3>
                <p>
                  The Redeemed Christian church of God, Stichting Glory Tabernacle Parish was
                  created in 2007 by two families by Pastor Mrs Bukky Olowu,
                  Pastor Adesuwa Bazuya, Brother Raphael Mamudu and the Adejumo
                  family.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pastor Adesuw remained the pastor GTP till she moved with her
                  family to Canada. Then the leadership of the church was handed
                  over to Pastor Samuel Ekpo for half a year until he relocated
                  to the U.S. Pastor Dennis Shakka assumed the leadership of the
                  church in 2014 till date. To the glory of God the church has
                  experienced several leadership transitions and challenge, yet
                  the church has kept on waxing stronger and stronger till date.

            >
            <p>
              The God who created the earth and everyone on it. This pursuit for
              God led him to the Church Missionary Society where he was baptized
              in 1927. Still spiritually unfulfilled, he joined the Cherubim and
              Seraphim Church in 1931.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whilst there, he began to hear a voice within him saying, You will
              be my servant. Since this was not his intention, he decided to
              ignore the voice. This went on for seven years during which all
              the business ventures that he tried resulted into failure. In debt
              and without peace of mind, he found himself totally dependent on
              the grace of God. Here marked the beginning of a definite
              relationship with God.Totally broken, he yielded saying, Lord, I
              will go wherever you want me to go. He asked for signs to confirm
              that this was indeed God’s call. The confirmation came through the
              Bible passages of Jeremiah 1:4-10, Isaiah 41:10-13 and Romans
              8:29-31. The Lord assured him that He would provide for all his
              needs, as he would not receive any salary from that point on. This
              proved to be a comforting reminder during the trials in the months
              ahead. He became married in 1941. He continued to worship with the
              Cherubim and Seraphim. In 1947, he started to become concerned
              that the church was departing from the true Word of God in some of
              its practices. By 1952, he felt totally persuaded to leave the
              church. He started at Willoughby Street, Ebute-Metta, Lagos a
              house-fellowship called, the Glory of God Fellowship. Initially
              there were nine members but before long the fellowship rapidly
              grew as the news of the miracles that occurred in their midst
              spread.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pa Akindayomi also had a vision of words that appeared to be
              written on a blackboard. The words were The Redeemed Christian
              Church of God. Amazingly, Pa Akindayomi who could not read or
              write was supernaturally able to write these words down. In this
              visitation, God also said to him that this church would go to the
              ends of the earth and that when the Lord Jesus Christ appeared in
              glory, He would meet the church. The Lord then established a
              covenant with Pa Akindayomi, synonymous to the Abrahamic covenant
              in the Bible. He said that He the Lord would meet all the needs of
              the church in an awesome way if only members would serve Him
              faithfully and be obedient to His Word. It is upon this covenant
              that the Redeemed Christian Church of God was built.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, the Redeemed Christian Church of God was born in 1952,
              destined by the Lord Himself to take the world for Him. The church
              continued to meet at 9 Willoughby Street until they were able to
              acquire some land thereby witnessing a relocation to the present
              site of the Headquarters of the church at 1-5 Redemption Way,
              Ebute-Metta, Lagos (formerly 1a, Cemetery Street).
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometime in the early 70s, God had spoken to Pa Akindayomi about
              his successor. The Lord told him that this man who was not a
              member of the church then, would be a young educated man. Thus
              when a young university lecturer joined the church in 1973, Papa
              was able to recognize him in the Spirit as the one that the Lord
              had spoken about in the past. This man, Enoch Adejare Adeboye who
              was then a lecturer of Mathematics at the University of Lagos soon
              became involved in the church. He became one of the interpreters
              translating Pa Akindayomi sermons from Yoruba to English. He was
              ordained a pastor of the church in 1975.
            </p>
            <p>
              Papa was preparing to meet his Creator. He sent for Pastor E.A
              Adeboye and spent several hours sharing with him details of the
              covenant and the plans of the Lord for the church. Even though a
              year before this, the Lord had revealed to Pastor E.A Adeboye that
              he would be Papa successor, it was still too difficult for him to
              fully contemplate such an awesome responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pa Josiah Akindayomi was 71 years old when he died. Amidst
              controversy, Pastor E.A Adeboye appointment was formalized by the
              reading of Pa Akindayomi sealed pronouncement after his burial.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since 1981, an open explosion began with the number of parishes
              growing in leaps and bounds. At the last count, there are at least
              about 2000 parishes of the Redeemed Christian Church of God in
              Nigeria. On the International scene, the church is present in
              other African nations including Ghana, Zambia, Malawi, Zaire,
              Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Gambia, Cameroon, and South Africa. In
              Europe the church is spread in England, Germany, the Netherlands
              and France. In the United States there are parishes in Dallas,
              Tallahassee, Houston, New York, Washington, and Chicago and also
              in the Caribbean states of Haiti and Jamaica.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, God is still doing marvelous deeds through the Redeemed
              Christian Church of God, worldwide. One of the well-known programs
              of the church is the Holy Ghost Service, an all night miracle
              service that holds on the first Friday of every month at the
              Redemption Camp at Km. 46, Lagos-Ibadan expressway. The average
              headcount of those who attend the Service is about 500,000. The
              Holy Ghost Service now holds in different parts of the world which
              includes the Europe, United Kingdom, India, USA, Canada, South
              Africa, Australia, Dubai, Ghana, Philippines and many more.
